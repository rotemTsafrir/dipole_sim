# dipole_sim
A simple simulation of wire antennas.  

For now the only availble antenna is a cnter fed thin dipole antenna.

Click the "Dipole antenna" button to place the endpoints of the new antenna and then press the "Simulate" button.
You can add multiple antennas by repeating this process.

Clicking on each antenna will toggle a small window with slides that control the amplitude, phase and feed speration of the antenna.

To the right of the simulation region there  are multiple buttons and two slides.

One slides controls thd frequency of all the sourcess (antennas) and the other controls the speed of light in the vaccume in the simulation. 

You need to press the "Simulate" after each cange in the setup of the simulation.
This includes changing the frequency, speed of light, adding a new antenna or changing the amplitude, phase or feed seperation of an antenna.


You can pause the sinulation by pressing the "Pause" button.
You can continue the simulation by clicking the "Resume" button.
