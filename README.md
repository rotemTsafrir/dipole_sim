A simple, interactive simulation of wire antennas

This simulation visualizes the electromagnetic fields generated by center-fed thin dipole antennas placed in a 2D plane. It is designed for exploration and intuition-building around antenna radiation and field behavior.

🛰️ Features and Usage

🎯 Placing Antennas
	1.	Click “Dipole Antenna”.
	2.	Click twice on the canvas to place the endpoints of the antenna.
	3.	Press “Simulate” to update the simulation.

You can add multiple antennas by repeating the above steps.

🎚️ Antenna Controls
	•	Click on an antenna to open its control panel.
	•	Use the sliders to adjust:
	•	Amplitude
	•	Phase
	•	Feed separation

⚙️ Global Simulation Controls

On the right side of the canvas:
	•	Sliders:
	•	Frequency: Sets the frequency for all antennas.
	•	Speed of Light: Adjusts the simulated wave propagation speed.
	•	Buttons:
	•	Simulate: Must be clicked after any change (antenna properties, new antenna, frequency, etc.)
	•	Pause / Resume: Toggles animation.

🌌 Field Visualization

The simulation displays fields on the same 2D plane that contains all antenna wires. This has specific consequences:
	•	The electric field (E) lies in the plane.
	•	The magnetic field (B) is perpendicular to the plane.
	•	The Poynting vector (energy flux) lies in the plane.

📍 Top-Right Display Options

At the top right of the canvas, you’ll find three toggle buttons:
	1.	Show E Field (default)
	•	Displays the electric field.
	•	Color heatmap shows magnitude.
	•	Small arrows indicate direction.
	2.	Show B Field
	•	Since B is out-of-plane, it is represented as a scalar field:
	•	Red/Blue heatmap indicates the sign (direction into or out of the plane).
	•	Brightness corresponds to magnitude.
	3.	Show Energy Flux
	•	Displays the Poynting vector field (power flux density).
	•	Since it’s in-plane, it’s shown like E:
	•	Color heatmap = magnitude.
	•	Small arrows = direction of energy flow.

📝 Notes
	•	Always click “Simulate” after:
	•	Adding a new antenna
	•	Changing any antenna’s settings
	•	Adjusting frequency or wave speed
	•	You can pause and resume the simulation at any time.
